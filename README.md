- (✿◡‿◡) Howdy, I’m @slendy33!
- (⌐■_■) I’m interested in game development and web design.
- ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I’m currently learning html, css, and javascript.
- ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Pronouns: They/Them
- (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧ Fun fact: I'm working on a game in Unity with my partner at the moment (I'm an artist so I'm mostly doing art assests atm but I would like to try coding games as well!), and I'm trying to create a Web 1.0-esque website for fun!
